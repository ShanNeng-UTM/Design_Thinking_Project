# Design_Thinking_Project

Based on the theme given, "Big Data and Artificial Intelligence New Innovation", we came up with an idea of develop an AI-powered weather prediction and travel assistance application. The application aims to enhance the travel experience by enabling users to stay well-prepared, and minimize the changing of travel plan due to unfavorable weather conditions.

# Reflection:
### What is your goal/dream with regard to your course/program?
My goal with regard to my course, Graphics and Multimedia Software,
is to explore more programming languages, master them and become a
full stack developer. By the end of this course, I hope to have the
opportunity to use my knowledge, to develop some useful technologies
that can enhance our daily lives or pursue a career as a game developer
or animation creator, bringing fun and happiness to others.
### How does this design thinking impact on your goal/dream with regard to your program?
From this design thinking project, I gained some experience in
collaborating in a team, to solve issues with our creativity and critical
thinking skills. Looking back on this journey, we tried hard to
brainstorm on how to make the user interface cleaner and easier to
understand for all users. Through this process, I learned that user
experience is one of the most critical aspects to focus on when
developing software or mobile applications.
### What is the action/improvement/plan necessary for you to improve your potential in the industry?
To improve my potential in the industry, I need to participate in
workshops and do self-learning to gain extra knowledge beyond the
knowledge which can be learned in my course. Besides, I also need to
participate in events or competitions to increase my visibility and show
my skills and abilities in different fields.
